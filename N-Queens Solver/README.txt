This Java program takes in user input to solve the N-Queens problem, a well-known mathematical dilemma of arranging an n amount of queens on a n by n chessboard so that no queen attacks another (including coverage of horizontals, diagonals and verticals).

The user has the choice to prompt the program to determine whether their custom arrangement of n queens on a n by n chessboard results in a legal position, or to prompt the program to generate the first solution and total number of solutions given n queens.

Used for CS2223 Algorithms assignment.
