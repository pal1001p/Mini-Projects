Analytical Student Support App
Palina Pyachynskaya
January 2024

This program allows the user to track their financial transactions over the course of a certain period of time, and determine whether the sum of these transactions corresponds with the user's budget goals. This is geared towards an audience of college students that may be limited with their funds.

The user is prompted to enter the amount of money spent on a certain day/week, as well as their preferred budget. The program keeps track of the user's spendings and provides updates on budget status to alert the user if they are on track with their goals. 

Used for the 2024 WPI GoatHacks Hackathon. Made in under 48 hours with partner Maggie Hosie.
