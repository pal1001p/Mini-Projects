This program prompts the user to choose between three options for tracking a coffee shop's business information. The user may request the program to print out either the sales for an item across 12 months, a text file containing total sales, or the most popular item (based on fed data).

To compile the program, run the command:
	gcc coffee_shop.c register.c -o register

or run the command make register.

To run the program, run the command:
	./register
and then enter a number when prompted.

Used for CS2303 Systems Programming Concepts assignment.
