API Weather App
Palina Pyachynskaya
January-February 2024

This program takes in user arguments in the form of a city name and outputs common information relevant to that city's climate, including temperature, humidity and wind speed. Weather icons change to reflect that city's current weather as well as time of day (i.e. showing a full moon if that city is currently experiencing clear conditions at night). 

All information is drawn from Open Weather API.
